# Development

There are 3 ways to develop:

1. Change and run tests on local machine:

   - add a new functionality or change any existing
   - change `variables.json` file in the root folder
   - change related tests of changed functionality

2. Link this repository with your real project as its dependence:
   - In `figma-extractor` repository, it's necessary to run `pnpm link --global`. It creates a link inside the cache folder of pnpm with name: `@shakuroinc/figma-extractor`
   - Inside your project, you need to run `pnpm link --global @shakuroinc/figma-extractor`. It should replace your real package `@shakuroinc/figma-extractor` in node_module to earlier created link as symbol link folder.
   - Inside `figma-extractor` folder, you need to launch `yarn build` every time after any changes. It's necessary to create compiled JS files into `dist` folder for proper work.
   - Inside project folder, you can run `pnpm extract` to launch your linked `figma-extractor`.

> Remember! You need to launch `yarn build` after any changes in `figma-extractor` repository

> Note: In this case, you create a just a link between extractor and your project without installing `peerDependecies` of `figma-extractor`
> If you want to install `peerDependecies` you should use 3 way which is described below

3. Link this repository with your real project through file protocol:
   - Inside your project, you need replace the line `"@shakuroinc/figma-extractor": "{number of your current version}"` inside `package.json` to `"@shakuroinc/figma-extractor": "file:{here the absolute path of figma-extractor folder}"`.
   - This way creates link between your project and figma-extractor and installs all `peerDependecies` of figma-extractor.
   - Launch `pnpm install` in the root of your project to create a link
   - Use `pnpm extract` as usually

> Remember! You need to launch `yarn build` as well when there are any changes in `figma-extractor` repository
